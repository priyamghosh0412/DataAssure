# 🧪 DataAssure — Data Validation Framework

![DataAssure Logo](dataassure_logo.png)

**DataAssure** is a lightweight yet powerful **data validation framework** built from scratch in Python using Streamlit.

> ✨ **Inspired by [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/)**, but built without any external profiling libraries — this is a completely custom, minimal implementation designed for flexibility, ease of use, and quick validation.

It enables users to define expectations on datasets, validate them through a user-friendly web interface, and generate downloadable validation reports — all without writing a line of code.
